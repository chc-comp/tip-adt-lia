[Original repo](https://github.com/ndreuu/TIP-no-NAT/releases/tag/chc-comp-23)

Benchmarks for competing CHC solvers on [CHC-COMP](https://chc-comp.github.io/) competition.

Adapted from pure ADT benchmarks taken from [``Tons of Inductive Problems''](https://github.com/tip-org/benchmarks).

Clauses are generally **not** linear.

- [`adt_lia`](adt_lia) contains CHC systems over `QF_DTLIA`
